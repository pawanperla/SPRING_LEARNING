# SPRING_LEARNING

This is a repo that tracks my spring learnings

## mvnw files

These files are deleted because it is not needed when working. Basically, these files are there in your directory to install latest maven version and to run the project. When you have maven installed locally on your computer it is not needed to add these files in the directory. Thats why deleted those two files.
